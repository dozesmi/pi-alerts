# pi-alerts
This is a tool that uses the PredictIt API to automate some
tasks in order to make it easier to place bets.

In order to recieve text message notifications a Twilio account
needs to be set up. An trial account is free and comes with enough
credit starting out to send around 1500 messages. You will need to set up 
two environment variables with your Twilio account id and its key. 
Instructions are available at https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html
In addition you should edit pi-alerts.py with your phone number and the phone number on your Twilio account.
